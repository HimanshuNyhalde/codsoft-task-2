📄 Project Description:
This project involves developing a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player can play against an unbeatable AI opponent. The AI agent uses the Minimax algorithm, optionally with Alpha-Beta Pruning, to determine the best possible move at each turn. By simulating all possible game outcomes, the AI ensures optimal decisions, making it impossible for the human player to win if the AI plays first.

This project introduces the fundamentals of game theory, search algorithms, and decision-making under constraints, making it an excellent starting point for understanding how intelligent agents plan and act.

🕹️ Game Features:
Human vs. AI gameplay in the console.

AI plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm.

Optional Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve performance.

Displays game board updates after each move.

Declares the winner or a draw at the end.

🧠 Learning Objectives:
Understand the rules and logic of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Learn how the Minimax algorithm evaluates game states.

Understand recursive decision trees and game outcomes.

Explore Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize recursive algorithms.

Strengthen skills in control flow, data structures, and recursion.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

No external libraries required (console-based)

📈 Future Enhancements (Optional):
Add a GUI interface using Tkinter or Pygame.

Implement two-player mode (human vs. human).

Create a difficulty selector (easy, medium, hard).

Log game history and stats for analysis.

📌 Example Algorithms Used:
Minimax: Explores all possible moves and their consequences to choose the best move for the AI.

Alpha-Beta Pruning (optional): Reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the minimax algorithm, improving efficiency.
